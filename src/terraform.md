# Terraform


If you need dynamic information, you can use datasources instead of variables. Datasources will pull their information from a remote API before it turns into a variable that can be used in *.tf files

The terraform.tfstate can be read easily by opening the terraform.tfstate file in a text editor. You will see that the contents is in the JSON format. It can even be changed manually (if you know what you're doing).
