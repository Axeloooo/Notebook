## Unit Testing

- A unit testing must only test one specific unit of functionality
- It is fast (Less than 10 minutes to build)
- It does not access a database or the file system
- It does not communicate through a network
- It does not require any special setup to the system environment such as modifying a configuration file
- It leaves the system and the system environment in the same state that it had prior to the test
- Focus on developed components only
